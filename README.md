# Basic-Js-todo

A very basic Todo app made with pure javascript.  No Node or NPM packages were used to create this todo app, it was simply an exercise in the creation of an app.

For use, just run the index.html file in your browser.  Click add to add a todo and the DONE! button to remove that todo.
Click removal all to remove all todos.
